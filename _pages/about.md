Yan Zhu is a Ph.D. student in Computer Science at Tulane University.
His research spans interactive machine learning, visualization, human-in-the-loop (HITL) AI, and explainable AI (XAI). He focuses on developing human-centered methods that couple human expertise with machine learning processes to support model interpretation, steering, and iterative model improvement.

He is advised by Prof. Rebecca Faust, working on projects related to interactive model understanding and user-guided model refinement.
Before joining Tulane, he worked as a Research Assistant in the Lichtman Laboratory at Harvard University, contributing to large-scale electron microscopy data analysis for developmental connectomics.
